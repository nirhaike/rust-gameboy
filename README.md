# Rust-GameBoy

A rust library that emulates the GameBoy/GameBoy Color's Z80-like CPU and it's peripherals, without using rust's standard library (making it suitable for embedded environments).

## Etc.
I consider myself a novice rustacean. While this project is still an early WIP, design-pattern suggestions and pull requests will be warmly welcomed.
This project was made for getting experienced in rust and entirely for fun and non-profit purposes.
